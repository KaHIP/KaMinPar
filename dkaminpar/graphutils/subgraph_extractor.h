/*******************************************************************************
 * Utility functions to extract and distribute block-induced subgraphs
 * of a partitioned distributed graph.
 *
 * These functions build an in-memory subgraph graph for each block of a
 * partitioned distributed graph. The blocks are assigned to PEs. If there are
 * fewer PEs than blocks, each PE gets multiple subgraphs, otherwise each
 * subgraph is duplicated and copied to multiple PEs.
 * The functions aim to distribute the subgraphs as evenly as possible.
