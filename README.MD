# KaMinPar

**KaMinPar** is a parallel heuristic solver for the balanced k-way graph partitioning problem.
Given a graph, it aims to divide its vertices into k disjoint blocks of approximately equal weight, minimizing the number of edges crossing between blocks.
KaMinPar offers high efficiency and low memory overheads while achieving partitions of similar quality as the widely used Metis algorithm.
For example, it can partition the massive [hyperlink-2012](https://webdatacommons.org/hyperlinkgraph/index.html) graph (approx. 3.5 billion vertices and 112 billion edges) into 30,000 blocks in under 6 minutes on 96 cores, using around 300 GiB RAM.
Notably, KaMinPar is optimized for large k, where it often achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup over competing partitioners.
For unweighted input graphs, it guarantees strict adherence to the balance constraint.

## Installation Notes

### Requirements

* **Compiler:** C++20-ready GCC or Clang compiler
* **Dependencies:** CMake, oneAPI TBB, MPI (optional)
* **System:** Linux (x86, ARM) or macOS (ARM)

### Quickstart

After cloning the repository, follow the standard CMake build procedure:

```shell
cmake -B build --preset=default
cmake --build build --parallel
```

To partition a graph in METIS format (see, e.g., the [KaHIP manual](https://github.com/KaHIP/KaHIP/raw/master/manual/kahip.pdf)), run:

```shell
# KaMinPar: shared-memory partitioning
./build/apps/KaMinPar [-P default|terapart|strong|largek] -G <graph filename> -k <number of blocks> -t <nproc> [-o <output partition>]

# dKaMinPar: distributed partitioning
mpirun -n <nproc> ./build/apps/dKaMinPar [-P default|strong|xterapart] -G <graph filename> -k <number of blocks> [-o <output partition>]
```

The computed partition is written to a text file (controlled via `-o <filename>`), where the n-th line contains the block ID (0-based) of the n-th node.

There are multiple configuration presets that tune the algorithm for different scenarios:

* `-P default`: fast partitioning with quality comparable to Metis
* `-P terapart`: same partition quality as `default`, but with reduced memory consumption (slightly slower)
* `-P strong`: better quality than `default` through additional FM refinement at the cost of increased runtime
* `-P largek`: faster for large values of k (e.g., k > 1024); reduces partition quality slightly for smaller k

Configuration presets can be inspected using the `--dump-config` flag.
To build a custom configuration, dump one of the presets to a file, modify it and load it using `-C <filename>`:

```shell
./build/KaMinPar -P terapart --dump-config > custom.ini
# ... modify custom.ini ...
./build/KaMinPar -C custom.ini <...>
```

Important command line arguments include:

* `-G <graph filename>`: Points to the input graph in METIS format
* `-t <nproc>`: Controls the number of threads to be used, **defaults to single-threaded execution**
* `-k <k>`: Controls the number of blocks in the partition (if all blocks should be subject to the same maximum block weight controlled by `-e`)
* `-e <epsilon>`: Controls the maximum imbalance, e.g., `-e 0.03` to allow 3% imbalance, **defaults to 3%**
* `-B <W0> <W2> ... <Wk-1>`: Explicitly specifies the maximum block weights, i.e., the weight of the i-th block should be bounded by `Wi`
* `-b <w0> <w2> ... <wk-1>`: Same as `-B`, but specifies the maximum weights as fractions of the total node weight, i.e., the weight of the i-th block should be bounded by `wi * total node weight`

General command line arguments:

* `--version`: Prints the build configuration and current version
* `-q`: Quiet mode, suppresses all console output
* `-v`: Verbose mode, output more info during partitioning; pass `-v` multiple times to increase verbosity
* `-T`: Outputs the full timer tree
* `--validate`: Enables basic input graph validation

## Using the C++ Library Interface

If you are using CMake, you can use the partitioners as libraries by adding this repository as a Git submodule to your project and including it in your CMake configuration:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(external/KaMinPar)

target_link_libraries(<your-target> PUBLIC KaMinPar::KaMinPar)  # Shared-memory partitioning
target_link_libraries(<your-target> PUBLIC KaMinPar::dKaMinPar) # Distributed partitioning
```

Alternatively, you can use `FetchContent`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(KaMinPar
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/KaHIP/KaMinPar.git
  GIT_TAG main)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(KaMinPar)
set_property(DIRECTORY "${KaMinPar_SOURCE_DIR}" PROPERTY EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL YES) # optional

target_link_libraries(<your-target> PUBLIC KaMinPar::KaMinPar)  # Shared-memory partitioning
target_link_libraries(<your-target> PUBLIC KaMinPar::dKaMinPar) # Distributed partitioning
```

The shared-memory partitioner can be used as follows:

```c++
#include <kaminpar-shm/kaminpar.h>
using namespace kaminpar;

KaMinPar shm(int num_threads, shm::create_default_context());

// Pass a copy of the graph:
shm.copy_graph(
  std::span<const EdgeID> xadj, 
  std::span<const NodeID> adjncy, 
  std::span<const NodeWeight> vwgt = {}, 
  std::span<const EdgeWeight> adjwgt = {}
);

// Alternatively, let KaMinPar borrow the graph: this avoids the copy, but the
// spans must stay valid throughout partitioning and KaMinPar might modify the 
// data:
shm.borrow_and_mutate_graph(
  std::span<EdgeID> xadj, 
  std::span<NodeID> adjncy, 
  std::span<NodeWeight> vwgt = {}, 
  std::span<EdgeWeight> adjwgt = {}
);

// Compute a `k`-way partition where each block weight is bounded by 
// `(1 + epsilon) * average`:
shm.compute_partition(BlockID k, double epsilon, std::span<BlockID> out_partition);

// Compute a `max_block_weights.size()`-way partition where the `i`-th block 
// weight is bounded by `max_block_weights[i]`:
shm.compute_partition(std::vector<BlockWeight> max_block_weights, std::span<BlockID> out_partition);

// Compute a `max_block_weight_factors.size()`-way partition where the `i`-th 
// block weight is bounded by `max_block_weight_factors[i] * total_weight`:
shm.compute_partition(std::vector<double> max_block_weight_factors, std::span<BlockID> out_partition);
```

The distributed-memory partitioner can be used as follows:

```c++
#include <kaminpar-dist/dkaminpar.h>
using namespace kaminpar;

dKaMinPar dist(MPI_Comm comm, int num_threads, dist::create_default_context());

// Pass a copy of the graph:
dist.copy_graph(
  std::span<GlobalNodeID> vtxdist, 
  std::span<GlobalEdgeID> xadj, 
  std::span<GlobalNodeID> adjncy, 
  std::span<GlobalNodeWeight> vwvgt = {}, 
  std::span<GlobalEdgeWeight> adjwgt = {}
);

// Compute a `k`-way partition where each block weight is bounded by 
// `(1 + epsilon) * average`:
dist.compute_partition(BlockID k, double epsilon, std::span<BlockID> out_partition);

// Compute a `max_block_weights.size()`-way partition where the `i`-th block 
// weight is bounded by `max_block_weights[i]`:
dist.compute_partition(std::vector<BlockWeight> max_block_weights, std::span<BlockID> out_partition);

// Compute a `max_block_weight_factors.size()`-way partition where the `i`-th 
// block weight is bounded by `max_block_weight_factors[i] * total_weight`:
dist.compute_partition(std::vector<double> max_block_weight_factors, std::span<BlockID> out_partition);
```
