# KaMinPar

The graph partitioning software KaMinPar -- Karlsruhe Minimal Graph Partitioning. 

KaMinPar is a shared-memory parallel tool to heuristically solve the graph partitioning problem: divide a graph into k disjoint blocks of roughly equal weight while
minimizing the number of edges between blocks.
Competing algorithms are mostly evaluated for small values of k. If k is large, they often compute highly imbalance solutions, solutions of low quality or suffer excessive running time.
KaMinPar substantially mitigates these problems.
It computes partitions of comparable quality to other high-quality graph partitioning tools while guaranteeing the balance constraint for unweighted input graphs.
Moreover, for large values of k, it is an order of magnitude faster than competing algorithms.

## Installation Notes

### Requirements

* Modern C++-20 ready compiler such as `g++` version 10 or higher
* CMake 
* Intel Thread Building Blocks library (TBB)

### Building KaMinPar

To build the software, clone this repository and type
```shell
./build.sh
```

Alternatively, you can use the standard CMake build process:

1. Clone the repository including submodules: `git clone --depth=1 --recursive git@github.com:KaHIP/KaMinPar.git`
2. Create a build: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Run CMake: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
4. Build the software: `make -j`

The resulting binary is located in `build/apps/KaMinPar`.

## Running KaMinPar

To partition a graph in METIS format using KaMinPar, run

```shell
./KaMinPar -G <graph filename> -k <number of blocks> -t <number of threads> -e <max. imbalance, e.g., 0.03 for 3%> 
```

A list of all options is available using the `--help` argument.
For a description of the graph format, please have a look at the [KaHiP manual](https://github.com/KaHIP/KaHIP/raw/master/manual/kahip.pdf).
