# Python Bindings for KaMinPar

[KaMinPar](https://github.com/KaHIP/KaMinPar) is a shared-memory parallel tool to heuristically solve the graph partitioning problem: divide a graph into k disjoint blocks of roughly equal weight while minimizing the number of edges between blocks. This package is a Python wrapper for KaMinPar and enables seamless integration of KaMinPar powerful partitioning algorithms into Python workflows.

## Installation

You can install the Python bindings for KaMinPar via pip:

```sh
pip install kaminpar
```

Alternatively, you can build the bindings from source. By default, the Python bindings are built with 64-bit node and edge IDs and node and edge weigths. To build the Python bindings with 32-bit IDs and weights, you can additionally pass the configuration flag `--config-settings=cmake.define.KAMINPAR_PYTHON_64BIT=OFF` to `pip install`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KaHiP/KaMinPar.git
pip install KaMinPar/bindings/python
```

When building the Python bindings from source, the dependencies of KaMinPar must be available on the system. These include CMake, Intel TBB and Sparsehash. Additionally, if you install the package via pip on a target system and Python version where no pre-built wheel is available, the package will fall back to building from the source distribution. In this case, you must also ensure that the required dependencies are installed on your system.

## Usage

The following is a basic example of using the KaMinPar bindings. For the full API documentation, refer to the [documentation file](https://github.com/dsalwasser/KaMinPar/blob/shm/feat/bindings/bindings/python/src/kaminpar/__init__.pyi).

```python
import kaminpar

# Initialize the KaMinPar algorithm with one thread and the default settings.
instance = kaminpar.KaMinPar(num_threads=1, ctx=kaminpar.default_context())

# Load a graph stored in METIS format from disk, which can be optionally compressed during IO.
graph = kaminpar.load_graph("hyperlink.metis", kaminpar.GraphFileFormat.METIS, compress=False)

# Partition the graph into four blocks using imbalance factor 3%.
partition = instance.compute_partition(graph, k=4, eps=0.03)
edge_cut = kaminpar.edge_cut(graph, partition)
print("Computed a partition with an edge cut of", edge_cut)
```
