# NetworKit Bindings for KaMinPar

[KaMinPar](https://github.com/KaHIP/KaMinPar) is a shared-memory parallel tool to heuristically solve the graph partitioning problem: divide a graph into k disjoint blocks of roughly equal weight while minimizing the number of edges between blocks. This Python package provides bindings to KaMinPar and integrates with the [NetworKit](https://networkit.github.io/) library to offer a fast and scalable graph partitioning algorithm.

## Installation

You can install the NetworKit bindings for KaMinPar via pip:

```sh
pip install kaminpar_networkit
```

Alternatively, you can build the bindings from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KaHiP/KaMinPar.git
pip install KaMinPar/bindings/networkit
```

## Usage

The following is a basic example of how to use the KaMinPar bindings.

```python
import networkit
import kaminpar_networkit as kaminpar


graph = networkit.readGraph("graph.metis", networkit.Format.METIS)
networkit.overview(graph)

shm = kaminpar.KaMinPar(graph)
partition = shm.computePartitionWithFactors([0.53, 0.253, 0.253])

edge_cut = networkit.community.EdgeCut().getQuality(partition, graph)
print("Computed a partition with an edge cut of ", edge_cut)
```
